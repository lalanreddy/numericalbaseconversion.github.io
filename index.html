			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Numerical Base Conversion Tutorial!
				 This tutorial will walk you through how to use our code to convert numbers 
				 between different numerical bases. If you're not sure what a numerical base is or how it works, 
				 don't worryâ€”we'll cover that in the next section. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to 
				 easily convert numbers between different bases and perform calculations in different bases..</p></div>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>To get started with our code, you'll need to download it from our website and install 
				it on your computer. Once you've done that, you can open the program and start converting numbers!
				 If you run into any issues with installation or setup, don't hesitate to reach out to our 
				 support team for help.</p>

			<h2>Selecting a Base</h2>
			<div class="three">
			<p>Before we can convert numbers between different bases, we need to understand
				 what a numerical base is. A numerical base is the number of digits used to
				  represent numbers in a particular numbering system. For example, in the decimal 
				  (base-10) numbering system, there are 10 digits (0 through 9) that are used to represent numbers. 
				  In the binary (base-2) numbering system, there are only 2 digits (0 and 1). Our code supports 
				  conversion between several different bases, including decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
				   To select a base in our code, simply specify the desired base as an input parameter.</p></div>

			<h2>Entering Numbers</h2>
			<p>Once you've selected a base in our code, you can start entering numbers to be converted.
				 To enter a number, simply type it in using the appropriate digits for the selected base. 
				 For example, if you're converting a number from binary to decimal, you would enter the binary number 
				 using only 0s and 1s. If you're converting a number from hexadecimal to binary, 
				 you would enter the hexadecimal number using digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F. 
				 Our code can convert numbers between any of the supported bases, so feel free to experiment!</p></div>

			<h2>Output</h2>
			<p>After you've entered a number to be converted, 
				our code will generate the converted number as output. 
				The output will be displayed in the selected base and can be read just like any other number.
				If you've converted a number to decimal, for example, you can perform arithmetic operations on it
				 just like any other decimal number.</p></div>

			<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
			<p>Here are some additional tips and tricks for using our code effectively:

				Use the code to perform calculations in different bases. 
				For example, you can add two binary numbers together or multiply a hexadecimal number by a decimal number.
				Experiment with different bases to see how different numbering systems work. 
				You might be surprised at how easy it is to perform calculations in bases other than decimal once 
				you get the hang of it!
				If you're not sure what base a number is in, you can often tell by looking at the digits 
				used to represent it. For example, if a number contains only 0s and 1s, it's probably in binary. 
				If it contains only digits 0 through 7, it's probably in octal.</p></div>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Congratulations! You've completed the Numerical Base Conversion Tutorial 
				and should now be comfortable with converting numbers between different bases. 
				If you'd like to learn more about numerical bases or perform more complex calculations in different bases, 
				there are many resources available online. Thanks for using our code, and happy converting!</p></div>
